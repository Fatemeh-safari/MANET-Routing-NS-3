## An Open Source project

ns-3 is a free open source project aiming to build a discrete-event
network simulator targeted for simulation research and education.
This is a collaborative project; we hope that
the missing pieces of the models we have not yet implemented
will be contributed by the community in an open collaboration
process.

The process of contributing to the ns-3 project varies with
the people involved, the amount of time they can invest
and the type of model they want to work on, but the current
process that the project tries to follow is described here:
https://www.nsnam.org/developers/contributing-code/

This README excerpts some details from a more extensive
tutorial that is maintained at:

## Building ns-3

The code for the framework and the default models provided
by ns-3 is built as a set of libraries. User simulations
are expected to be written as simple programs that make
use of these ns-3 libraries.

To build the set of default libraries and the example
programs included in this package, you need to use the
tool 'waf'. Detailed information on how to use waf is
included in the file doc/build.txt

However, the real quick and dirty way to get started is to
type the command
```shell
./waf configure --enable-examples
```

followed by

```shell
./waf
```

in the directory which contains this README file. The files
built will be copied in the build/ directory.

The current codebase is expected to build and run on the
set of platforms listed in the [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES)
file.

Other platforms may or may not work: we welcome patches to
improve the portability of the code to these other platforms.

## Running ns-3

On recent Linux systems, once you have built ns-3 (with examples
enabled), it should be easy to run the sample programs with the
following command, such as:

```shell
./waf --run simple-global-routing
```
